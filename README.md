# nimcorpora
A Nim interface for Darius Kazemi's [Corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora) project.

## Installation 
Since at the moment nimcorpora is not on nimble you can install it by its Github or Git link:

```
nimble install https://github.com/neroist/nimcorpora
```

or 

```
nimble install https://github.com/neroist/nimcorpora.git
```

After installation, Corpora's data will be installed to the packages's directory. If this fails for whatever reason, [report an error](https://github.com/neroist/nimcorpora/issues/new) and install and put the data in the `data/` directory in the package directory.
